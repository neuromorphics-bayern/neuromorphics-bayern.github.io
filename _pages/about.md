**Welcome! Grüße Sie!**

Welcome to the Neuromorphics Bayern Initiative. This is a research outlet and showcase for laboratories working on Neuromorphic Systems Engineering in Bavaria. With a focus spanning from neuromorphic hardware design to spiking neuronal network algorithms and application deployment, the initiative consolidates the local network of scientists and engineers working in brain-inspired computing. 


[Prof. Dr. Cristian Axenie](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/axenie-cristian/) coordinates the effort from the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/).
